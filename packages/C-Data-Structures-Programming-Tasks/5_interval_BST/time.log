ESTIMATE of time: 15 hours.
TOTAL time spent: 25 hours.

Difficulties:
* Figuring out how to incorporate isset_delete_node() into my code. In the end, I removed it entirely
because I was able to condense my isset_remove() to incorporate its functionality

* I had trouble understanding the value of **incoming because of the syntax. Eventually I realized
that it could save me a lot of frustration with promoting to children to the correct place

* merge_intervals() was tricky because there are two situations to account for. (1) is when
the item being added causes a simple append and prepend to its parent. (2) is when the item being
added is further down the tree. It took me a very long time to figure this out

* In hindsight, I should've implemented the splay functionality first because it was easier to
conceptualize and break down by cases as compared to the merging behavior
