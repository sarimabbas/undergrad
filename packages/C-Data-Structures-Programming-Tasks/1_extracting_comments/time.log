ESTIMATE of time: 5 hours.
TOTAL time spent: 10 hours.

Difficulties:
Initially I thought that I could complete the
assignment by writing if statements. But soon I realized my approach
would require the use of pointers. It was only when we covered state machines
and switches in class that I had an idea of how to tackle the pset without malloc/arrays.

It was difficult to visualize the state machine, and when I drew the machine
out, it had a lot of transitions and special cases. I asked other students
if the pset was difficult for them, but they replied the solution was simple,
so I got worried that I was overthinking my state machine. But there was no
radical change I could think of that could simplify my state machine; there
was just too many things to keep track of.

Modularizing my code was another problem. I was reluctant to break up my main function
into components, for fear of not having all my switch logic in the same place. I wish I had
more time to optimize my code.
