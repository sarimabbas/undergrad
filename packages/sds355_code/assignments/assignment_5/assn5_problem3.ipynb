    "# Assignment 5: Topic Models\n",

    "\n",
    "Due: Tuesday, November 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment has three problems. The first is about Bayesian inference. The second two are about topic models. You will first work with abstracts of scientific articles. These abstracts are obtained from arXiv.org, an open access repository for e-prints of articles in scientific fields maintained by Cornell University. You will then work with a collection of movie plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For your convenience, we have separated the problems into three notebooks: assn5_problem1.ipynb, assn5_problem2.ipynb, and assn5_problem3.ipynb. Submit your solutions in these three notebooks, printing out each as a separate pdf.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide significant \"starter code\" as discussed in lecture. We then ask you build topic models using the Python library gensim, and do some analysis over the topics obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ask that you please at least start the assignment right away. If you have any difficulties running gensim we would like to know!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 3: Topic Models on Movie Plots \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we will continue working with topic models, but this time with a new dataset. Instead of abstracts of scientific articles, we will create topic models over movie plot descriptions. This is a dataset containing descriptions of movies from Wikipedia. The dataset was [obtained](https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots) from Kaggle, an online community of data scientists. We again provide extensive starter code to process the data.\n",

    "Spoiler alert! We will use the movie \"[Husbands and Wives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husbands_and_Wives)\" as a running example...\n",

      "The film is about two couples: Jack (Pollack) and Sally (Davis), and Gabe (Allen) and Judy (Farrow). The film starts when Jack and Sally arrive at Gabe and Judy's apartment and announce their separation. Gabe is shocked, but Judy takes the news personally and is very hurt. Still confused, they go out for dinner at a Chinese restaurant.\n",
      "A few weeks later Sally goes to the apartment of a colleague. They plan to go out together to the opera and then to dinner. Sally asks if she can use his phone, and calls Jack. Learning from him that he has met someone, she accuses him of having had an affair during their marriage.\n",
      "Judy and Gabe are introduced to Jack's new girlfriend, Sam, an aerobics trainer. While Judy and Sam shop, Gabe calls Jack's new girlfriend a \"cocktail waitress\" and tells him that he is crazy for leaving Sally for her. About a week later, Judy introduces Sally to Michael (Neeson), Judy's magazine colleague who she clearly is interested in herself. Michael asks Sally out, and they begin dating; Michael is smitten, but Sally is dissatisfied with the relationship.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Gabe has developed a friendship with a young student of his, Rain, and has her read the manuscript of his novel. She comments on its brilliance, but has several criticisms, to which Gabe reacts defensively.\n",
      "At a party, Jack learns from a friend that Sally is seeing someone, and flies into a jealous rage.
