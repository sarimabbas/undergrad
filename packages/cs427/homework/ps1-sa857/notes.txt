2. main.cpp 
Type: source code 
Description: calls code from tools.hpp and petitions user for input to calculate age. 
After class on Sep 10th, I made a design decision to reprompt the user for input
after a non-integer is added for year of birth. In class, we learned about
status bits. Initially, I used cin.clear(), but after researching on the web, it
only clears the error bits on the stream, and does not remove the garbage input. 
So I learned that I can use cin.ignore(). But for this I would have to utilize <limits.h> in tools,
which was not mentioned in the specification, so I can ignore upto the maximum stream size till
the newline. I hope this is acceptable!

exits.
