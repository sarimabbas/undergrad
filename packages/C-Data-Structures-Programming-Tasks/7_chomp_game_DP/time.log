Difficulties:
* Rules of the game were a bit tricky to understand, and midterm-week time crunch made it less of
a priority. Instead, I mostly just wrote the code based on Prof. Glenn's notes and advice

* Valgrind was giving difficulties when initializing my smap, apparently mallocing keys in a loop
makes stuff go wonky

* Hardest function was successors, but overall the pset wasn't too bad.


Source(s) consulted:
* Prof. Aspnes' notes
* Data Structures Using C - Sharma
