6. The behavior of parsnip does not match bash in all particulars, including:

   a. parsnip does not recognize line splices outside of HERE documents.

   b. parsnip treats unterminated strings as syntactically invalid rather than
      prompt for continuation lines.

   b. Within a double-quoted string parsnip does not treat a \ that is followed
      by a $, `, or ! as an escape character.

   c. parsnip allows local variable definitions and input, output, or error
      redirection to precede a subcommand.

   d. parsnip treats commands like
	> FILE
      (missing command) and
	command >file1 >>file2
      (multiple input, output, or error redirection) as syntactically invalid.

   e. parsnip does not issue a prompt for each line in a HERE document when run
      interactively.

   f. parsnip does not read or expand any HERE documents when a command is not
      syntactically valid.

   g. parsnip does not expand environment variables on the command line.

   In such instances your code should reproduce the behavior of Hwk2/parsnip.
