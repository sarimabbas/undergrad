ESTIMATE of time: 15 hours.
TOTAL time spent: 25 hours.

Started on Wednesday Oct 4, Ended on Sunday Oct 8

Difficulties:
* Was getting valgrind errors until I realised I hadn't freed the lists in the cleanup strange
* Kept struggling with the unit test case till the very end
* Was confused about where to put the plist struct. Eventually moved it to plist.h, even though we
  were told not to change the header
* Was confused about how to cast the compare function for use with qsort, but eventually figured it out
  by Googling the specification for qsort
* Was difficult to read in arguments, but eventually figured it out by reading the spec for fscanf
  on reference.cs50.net
* Kept struggling with how to make each individual step run in O(n) time to give overall O(nlogn) time
* This took a long time, especially with search_middle and checking for distinctness
