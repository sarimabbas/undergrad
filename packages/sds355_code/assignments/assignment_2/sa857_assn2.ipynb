This formula is an alternative to actually carrying out the $n = 100$ regressions you would otherwise need for LOOCV. An example of how to calculate the projection matrix $H$ is provided below for the case of $n=5$ and the model $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 X^2 + \\epsilon$ . To get the diagonal elements of $H$ you may find the function `np.diag()` useful."
