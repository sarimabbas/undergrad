Banterboard
============

What is Banterboard?
-------------

This project was developed for CS 50 @ Yale. It is a social network where users can post text, images and other embeddable content to communities called boards. They can vote, comment and make private boards.

From neighborhoods, to classes, to group projects or just circles of friends, Banterboard can be a home for anyone.
