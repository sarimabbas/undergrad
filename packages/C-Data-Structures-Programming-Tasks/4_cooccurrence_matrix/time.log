Difficulties:
* I began this pset early, but it was a lot more complicated than expected.

* For one thing, I wasn't sure how to implement my smap, either with chaining or
open addressing. I started with chaining but embiggen was an issue so i switched to open
addressing

* Later, with coccurrence matrix, what was complicated was how to use the smap functionality
to store vectors and check for duplicates. I needed to use several "tricks", like a separate
value in keywords_orders to discard duplicates from context in suitable time complexity

* Reading in input was a pain too. getline() is a relatively recent function and I had to
distinguish between two situations: one in which EOF was reached, and one in which
my returned array had no relevant keyword inside it

* Truncating arrays to discard non-unique or NULL values was also a pain. I had to work
excessively with the heap and reallocate to get the arrays the right size

* I have used several resources to finish this pset. I used the djb2 hash function from
http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html. I consulted stack overflow to see how I could
use getline() and get rid of the warning messages I got. And I also had to use
reference.cs50.net to find out how all the string and pointer-related functions worked.
