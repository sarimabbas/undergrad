ESTIMATE of time: 10 hours.
TOTAL time spent: 17 hours.

Difficulties:
0. Accepting command line arguments in the correct format and order required
the use of many loops and counters

1. Working with arrays, copying them, trimming them and passing them to other
functions took me a very long time to figure out

2. Implementing the actual progression free algorithms was also difficult. I spent the most time
on greedy, after that it became much easier to tweak the algorithm for the other
two approaches

3. I was not able to implement opt, i did not have enough time :(
