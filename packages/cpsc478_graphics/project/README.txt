Effects implemented:
* Soft shadows (partial): I had difficulty with this, and was unable to get soft edges. 
* Perlin noise (success): I was able to successfully implement Perlin noise
using the Ken Perlin java adaptation. In the video, I was able to organically animate the noise
by using frame count as time dimension for z-coord of noise : )

I follow OOP wherever i can, so you'll find the textures (and most other things) in their own classes. 


How to build and run? 
1. Navigate to "previz" folder
2. Run "make" command
3. Run "./previz" command
4. Use CTRL+C to terminate after rendering the first frame. That is my
representative frame. I hope that's OK! I didn't want to write a whole other
program to generate just one frame hehee
5. The frame will be in the "frames" folder
