FlexArray is a flexarray that uses move assignment instead of memcopy
to move data during grow().
Item uses std::string to store the product name instead of 
const char* C-strings.
Item's move constructor and move assignment simply delegate the move
to moving each data member.
Item no longer has a dynamic extension, so there is no double-deletion
problem to solve and no need for a non-null destructor.
